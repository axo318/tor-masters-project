  o Minor bugfixes (tests):
    - Our option-validation tests no longer depend on specially configured
      non-default, non-passing set of options.  Previously, the tests had
      been written to assume that options would _not_ be set to their
      defaults, which led to needless complexity and verbosity.
      Fixes bug 32175; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha.
