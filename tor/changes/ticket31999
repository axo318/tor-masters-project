  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Our default log (which ordinarily sends NOTICE-level message to
      standard output) is now handled in a more logical manner. Previously,
      we replaced the configured log options if they were empty.
      Now, we interpret an empty set of log options as meaning "use the
      default log". Closes ticket 31999.
