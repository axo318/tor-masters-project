  o Major features (build system):
    - Create an optional relay module, which can be disabled using the
      --disable-module-relay configure option. When it is set, also disable
      the dirauth module. Add a minimal implemention, which disables the
      relay and dircache modes in tor. Closes ticket 32123.
