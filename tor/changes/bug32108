  o Major bugfixes (relay):
    - Relays now respect their AccountingMax bandwidth again. When relays
      entered "soft" hibernation (which typically starts when we've hit
      90% of our AccountingMax), we had stopped checking whether we should
      enter hard hibernation. Soft hibernation refuses new connections and
      new circuits, but the existing circuits can continue, meaning that
      relays could have exceeded their configured AccountingMax. Fixes
      bug 32108; bugfix on 0.4.0.1-alpha.
